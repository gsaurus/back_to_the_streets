 
  - Review MVC way VC are created, there should be a way of setting at least from constructor?
  
 - Physics System
    - Predefined velocity affectors: gravityControl, collisionControl, impulse00
    - [optional] Fix point over moving platform with diagonal normal
    - Read / Write static world from / to files ? can be directly on the scene..
    - World planes editor
    
 - States
 	- When to destroy dependant models?
 	- Consider identifying models with string keys, instead of uint ids?
    - What happens to input events during pause / not ready?

 - Network System (note: can be revisited later)
 	- Send what players are "Ready" to new joiners
 	- Time delay compensation: if events come too much in future, acelerate game; if too much in the past, slowdown
 	- Send game state every few seconds?
 	
 - Animation System
 	- Global transitions (transitions from any state)
 	- Conditions / Events editor 
 	
 - Beat'em up specific
 	- Hit box (box coordinates, enable/disable)
 	- Collision boxes, have sub-classes for specific effects
 		- common collision data (box coordinates, enable/disable, damage, anim delay, face direction type, target animation...)
 	
 	
 - [optional] FixedVector3 aditional operations
			MoveTowards 	Moves a point current in a straight line towards a target point.
			OrthoNormalize 	Makes vectors normalized and orthogonal to each other.
			Project 		Projects a vector onto another vector.
			ProjectOnPlane 	Projects a vector onto a plane defined by a normal orthogonal to the plane.
			Reflect 		Reflects a vector off the plane defined by a normal.
			RotateTowards 	Rotates a vector current towards target.
