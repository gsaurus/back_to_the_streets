 - Review MVC way VC are created, there should be a way of setting at least from constructor?
  
 - Physics System
    - Predefined velocity affectors: gravityControl, collisionControl, impulse
    - [optional] Fix particle over moving platform with diagonal normal
    - notion of stationary particle (landed), including moving particle over moving plane
    - Read / Write static world from / to files ? can be directly on the scene..
    - World planes editor
    
 - States
 	- Consider identifying modls with string keys, instead of uint ids?
    - What happens to input events during pause / not ready?

 - Network System (note: can be revisited later)
 	- Send what players are "Ready" to new joiners
 	
 - Animation System
 	- Global transitions (transitions from any state)
 	
 	
 - [optional] FixedVector3 aditional operations
			MoveTowards 	Moves a point current in a straight line towards a target point.
			OrthoNormalize 	Makes vectors normalized and orthogonal to each other.
			Project 		Projects a vector onto another vector.
			ProjectOnPlane 	Projects a vector onto a plane defined by a normal orthogonal to the plane.
