 
  
 - Input events like in the prototype
 - notion of stationary particle (landed), including moving particle over moving plane
 - Fix flikering when moving up on elevators
 - Prevent sliding, perhaps with friction, maybe subtract world velocity to collision restitution, or maybe check difference between world velocity and actual position change
 - Plane controller (set position)
 - RandomGenerator: server set a random seed
 - FixedFloat: Implicit convertions from float 
 - States: Allow multiple events for each keyframe, do not add lists of events
 - Physics System: Particle model and controller: position, velocity and forces (see prototype)
 - Plane model
 - Gravity
 - Particle VS Plane collisions
 - Define static update orders for physics and world collisions
